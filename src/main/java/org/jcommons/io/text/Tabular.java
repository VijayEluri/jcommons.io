 * A tabular construct that arranges data in columns and rows in read-only fashion.

 * This is actually a simplification of a tabular representation, as it avoids putting any semantics in the cells. All
 * cells are string values. If you need a view on the table where the data is interpreted, you need to put a view on the
 * data structure.
 *
 * One standard view on tabular data is a table that stores plain data under column headers. If you need this view,
 * please see <code>Table</code>. A modifiable representation with plain data is called a <code>Grid</code> which is an
 * implementation of <code>MutableTabular</code>.
